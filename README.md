# hello-github-world

It really was long overdue that I got myself a GitHub account. Don't ask me why it took me so long. I've been using git both personally and professionally for quite a while, just not with GitHub.

Anyway, as GitHub offers a little 'Hello World' tutorial when you sign up, I figured I'd go through it. This is the result.
